## Recommendations

1. **Fix Color Contrast Issues**
   - Review the gold-600 color used for taglines and category badges
   - Ensure all text meets WCAG AA minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
   - Consider darkening accent colors or using them only on dark backgrounds

### Medium Priority

1. **Conduct Manual Testing**
   - Test keyboard navigation flow throughout the site
   - Verify screen reader compatibility with NVDA/VoiceOver
   - Test all interactive elements for proper focus management

2. **Review Form Accessibility**
   - Ensure all form fields have associated labels
   - Add aria-describedby for form validation errors
   - Test form submission with assistive technologies

### Low Priority

1. **Enhance Landmarks**
   - Add skip-to-content link for keyboard users
   - Review ARIA landmark usage for screen reader navigation
